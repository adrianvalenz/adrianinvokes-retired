notes:
- algorithms process data
- data is stored in data structures
- an algorithm is just a process of doing something
- an algorithm is just a section of code that does something
- the code that we create for the algorithm will often be placed in a function
- a function is encapsulated code that you can call and it runs the algorithm
- dynamic array vs. linked list vs. array
- Big O Notation
