## Title

Setting up a Bridgetown blog with Prismic's Headless CMS

## Synopsis

In this talk we will go over how Bridgetown can be a great solution to offer
your clients for their company websites and how it can be expanded to a blog
using Prismic CMS using the official Bridgetown-Prismic plugin.

## Description

In this talk we will start with an existing client sample site and dive into how
the process of adding blogging functionality will look when the client requests
it. 

We will use the plugin repo as a reference to implementing and setting up our
models, API, as well as setting up Prismic, Render, and linking it all together.

For the configuration we will go over installing the plugin via the automoation
script, setting up draft
previews using Roda, configuring our model with the necessary attributes, and 
updating our views to indicate a preview page.

Then we will set up a Prismic account, tie in the API with our model, and set up
a yaml file to deploy to Render.

Once it is live we will create a post, view the preview, and publish it online
ensuring it works and ready for use!
